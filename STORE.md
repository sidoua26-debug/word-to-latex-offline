```
Convert Microsoft Word (.docx) documents, formatted text, and complex tables directly into clean, paste-ready LaTeX fragments — entirely client-side inside Microsoft Edge.

Word to LaTeX (Offline) brings the full power of Pandoc into your browser using WebAssembly. There are no server calls, no external APIs, and no accounts required. Your research papers, coursework, and confidential manuscripts never leave your computer.

KEY FEATURES:
• Dual Conversion Modes:
  1. Upload File: Select any .docx file for instantaneous local compilation.
  2. Paste Content: Paste rich text, formatted tables, or outlines copied from Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or web pages into the interactive editor. Structure, headers, bold, italics, and tabular columns are accurately preserved.
• Paste-Ready Fragments: Produces clean LaTeX snippets without unwanted \documentclass or \begin{document} wrappers, ready to drop straight into your existing Overleaf or TeXstudio projects.
• Automated Cleanup Pipeline: Automatically removes Pandoc's bare \tightlist artifacts, unwraps nested \pandocbounded{} commands, normalizes whitespace, and prepends a list of required LaTeX packages (\usepackage{booktabs}, \usepackage{longtable}, etc.) in comments.
• Instant Clipboard Sync: Converted LaTeX is immediately copied to your clipboard with a confirmation notice.
• 100% Offline & Private: Bundles all WebAssembly binaries and translation shims inside the extension. Works seamlessly without an internet connection.

Whether drafting mathematical papers, preparing thesis chapters, or converting tabular research data into booktabs syntax, Word to LaTeX (Offline) streamlines your typesetting workflow in Microsoft Edge.
